Test cases and bugs can be found in the Test Cases and Bugs folder.  There are 4 test cases written in excel in 4 different sheets.
The bugs can be found individually in the word documents.  The test automation can be ran but needs the Paylocity QA Challenge Zip file 
unzipped to the C: drive root.  Also, I used a firefox driver and my version of firefox is at 32.  I noticed the most up-to-date firefox
browser does not allow the navigate to URL method to point to a non http protocol so that is why I mention the FireFox version used.  Thank
you for your consideration.
